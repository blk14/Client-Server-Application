It is a Client-Server Application in which there are 3 components:
  - first component is the TCP client (subscriber) which represents a client who would want to subscribe to different topics. He can chose if he want to receive messages even though he is offline (he will receive all the collected messages, while he was offline, at once when he will be online back, similar with what is happening when we do not check or mail for a while). Or he can chose to do not receive anything while he is offline.
  - second component is a UDP client which has the role to generate messages from different topics to the server
  - the third component is the server which has a UDP connection with the second component and a TCP connection with the first component where it uses multiplexing for dealing easily with many subscribers. It has the role to parse the UDP messages and the TCP connections and messages (with the intention to memorise the subscribers and theirs actions of subscribing or unsibscribing to the topics). It takes the messages from the UDP and send them only to the clients which are subscribed to that topic. (It is similar with what gmail/yahoo does when a travel agency for example sends offers via email to their subscribers, what is more is that situation with online/offline choice of the subscribers).
